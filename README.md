# ComposeNewsApp

Simple News Reader App
This Android app is a straightforward news reader built using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for the UI, Retrofit for API calls, Hilt for dependency injection, and Navigation component for seamless user navigation. The app fetches news articles from a remote API and displays them in a list. Users can tap on any article to view its details on a separate screen.

The architecture follows best practices in Android development, ensuring modularity, testability, and scalability. Retrofit handles API requests efficiently, while Hilt simplifies dependency injection, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Navigation component provides a structured way to navigate between different screens, enhancing the user experience with predictable and smooth transitions.

Concepts used 
Jetpack Compose: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android UI.

Retrofit: Type-safe HTTP client for making API requests.

Hilt: Dependency injection library for Android that reduces boilerplate code.

Kotlin Coroutines : for Threading
